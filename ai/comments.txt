Our solution utilizes the minimax function with alpha-beta pruning.  The horizontal and vertical legal moves are ordered by preference so that the scoring is more likely to pick up and implement the prefered move.

We generate a list of possible moves based on each piece belonging to the player at that point in time, move the board, apply a score to the it with the evaluation function, then roll it back until we find the 'best' score and commit to that move.

Our evaluation function gives more weight to moves that are more likely block the opponent's pieces and moves that allow it a greater degree of freedom to move towards the goal state. At the most basic level we score our board state based on the squared distance that a piece has traveled in the direction of its goal.  The depth to which we traverse the minimax graph is chosen in order to optimize the speed of the calculations so that it is within the limits as specified in the Project Doc.

Furthermore, our names are very creative MEOW!!
