- Bot.java reads the input and puts it into an ArrayList.
- Board.java takes this ArrayList and builds the board configuration. It also tracks where each Vertical and Horizontal piece is on the board in two ArrayLists.
- Police.java checks if a Vertical or Horizontal move is legal for that piece.
- Moves.java defines the possible legal moves for the Horizontal and Vertical pieces, since there are only 3 legal moves for each piece type we restricted the possible moveset to these legal moves.

Libraries used:
	- java.util.ArrayList
	- java.util.Scanner

Reading in the board configuration is of order O(n^2) where n is the width/height of the board.
Checking legal moves requires O(2(n-1) * 3) = O(n), this is because there are a maximum of 2(n-1) pieces on the board at any time, and each piece has 3 possible moves.

Checking moves pseudo-code:
	for all horizontal pieces:
		do:
		if check move up is possible:
			then count<-count+1
		if check move right is possible:
			then count<-count+1
		if check move down is possible:
			then count<-count+1
	return count

	for all vertical pieces:
		do:
		if check move up is possible:
			then count<-count+1
		if check move right is possible:
			then count<-count+1
		if check move left is possible:
			then count<-count+1
	return count
